# OperationIds allowed to be called by the server.
#
# If this file contains ANY operationIds, the server will deny everything else.
#
# If this file is empty (or only '---'), the default server policy is:
#   - allow GET operations
#   - deny non-GET unless ALLOW_WRITE_OPERATIONS=true
#
# Examples:
# - getUsers
# - getRoutingQueues
# - postAnalyticsConversationsDetailsQuery
